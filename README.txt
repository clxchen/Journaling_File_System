This is an in-memory multithreaded fault tolerant Journaling File System(JFS) that could be used at top of any unix or linux distribution. The project was divided into four phases:
1. JFS without Multithreading and Fault Tolerance
2. JFS with Multithreading
3. JFS with fault tolerance
4. JFS with Multithreading and Fault tolerance

The final phase is the completion of project. Each folder is for different phases and contains the readme file, status report and makefile to run the test cases for the filesystem.

//README

This is a README file for this program
Due to lack of time was unable to provide all the functions in seperate files. But the functions are completely modular and thus can be interrupted and will resume from that state of cell storage system. As the cell storage and temperory data are managed in files(non-volatile storage) rather than using RAM. But as for reseting the state we have called a cleanup function, that removes all the state files. 
I am providing here the program with test cases already hard coded with certain parameters, in the same file. The complete code for journal file manager, storage units and cell storage and provided in seperate header files.
 
So following are the steps to compile and run the test cases:
1. Navigate to the directory 'src' and type 'make' in terminal.
2. Now run the file by typing './test_case' in terminal.
3. The file will run with three test cases checking for different situations and functionality of the program.
